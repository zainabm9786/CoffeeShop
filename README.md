Coffee Shop Dashboard


🎯 What I did:
• Analyzed 6 months of transaction data (Jan-June) across 3 NYC locations
• Built an interactive dashboard with 8 visualizations & pivot tables
• Used synchronized slicers to filter all charts simultaneously by location

📊 Revenue Analysis:
• January started with $81,677, followed by a slight dip in February to $76,145 (-6.8%)
• Revenue increased in March and kept rising until June
• Total revenue for the period was $698,812
• Busiest times: Weekday mornings (8-10 AM)
• Peak days: Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays
• Hell's Kitchen location was the top performer

🔍 Top Product Insights:
• Coffee drinks led revenue
• Bakery items were second-highest sellers
• Tea products rounded out the top 3
• Across all locations, the top three most bought items are Gourmet Brewed Coffee, Brewed Chai Tea, and Barista Espresso

💡 Business Recommendations:
